<a name="intro"></a></p><h3>Introduction</h3>
Aircraft pitot static systems have many possible sources of error, which 
will affect the indicated airspeed and altitude.  For IFR aircraft, it is 
important that the altimeter error be determined by a combination of 
instrument calibrations and flight test.  Airspeed error is worth 
measuring, but it is less important than altitude error from a safety 
perspective.<p>

These notes discuss the various pitot static system errors and describe 
techniques to reduce most of them, and determine the residual error.  An 
Excel spreadsheet, (<a href="ssec.zip">ssec.zip</a> for Excel 7,  <a href="ssec4.zip">ssec4.zip</a> for Excel 4) is available to do the 
required calculations.  The ZIP files include these notes.</p><p>

The spreadsheet uses a method which is accurate at any subsonic speed, up 
to 36,089 ft altitude (see <a href="#method">Technical Notes</a> for more 
detail).</p><p>

The spreadsheet makes use of a method to determine TAS from three legs on 
any track method developed by Doug Gray (<a href="doug_gray/TAS_FNL4.pdf">Measuring True Airspeed using GPS</a>). 

</p><p>

<a name="errors"></a></p><h3>Types of errors</h3>

<a name="pitot_errors"></a><u>Pitot system</u> - The pitot tube captures 
the total pressure of the airflow.  Total pressure is the sum of the 
static pressure and the dynamic (or ram) pressure.  One of the niceties of 
the laws of physics is that the total pressure remains the same even if 
the airflow is accelerated or decelerated around the aircraft.  If the 
flow is accelerated, the speed is higher, which increases the dynamic 
pressure, but the static pressure decreases (Bernoulii's Law), and the 
total pressure remains the same.  <p>

The pitot tube will give accurate readings as long as it is:

</p><ul>
<li>well clear of the prop wash,<p>

</p></li><li>not in the boundary layer,<p>

</p></li><li>not in the wake of some projection, and<p>

</p></li><li>aligned with the local flow within about 15 degrees (maybe up to 20 
degrees for pitot tubes made from tubing - NASA-Reference Paper-1046, 
Measurement of Aircraft Speed and Altitude).  Note that this condition may 
be violated at high angles of attack, which is one reason why most 
airspeed systems read too low at the stall.
</li></ul><p>

The pitot system is subject to leaks and it should be leak checked.  </p><p>

The airspeed indicator (ASI) is subject to instrument error and it should 
be calibrated.</p><p>

<a name="error_must_be_static"></a>In general, a leak-free pitot system 
with a calibrated airspeed indicator will be error free, except at high 
angles of attack (near the stall), where there may be a large angle 
between the local flow and the pitot tube.  Any other errors are most 
likely due to the static system.</p><p>
<a href="#Top">Top</a></p><p>

<a name="static_errors"></a><u>Static system</u> - The static system is 
much more prone to errors than the pitot system.  The purpose of the 
static system is to measure the free stream ambient pressure.  This is a 
bit of a trick because the aircraft causes the airflow to accelerate and 
decelerate as it passes by.  Bernoulii's Law tells us that the pressure 
will change as the speed of the air changes, so it is very difficult to 
find a place where the local pressure is the same as the free stream 
ambient pressure.</p><p>

The static system is subject to Position Error, which is caused by the 
fact that the pressure at the static port differs from the free stream 
ambient pressure.</p><p>

The static system is also subject to leaks and instrument error.</p><p>

<a name="gen_test"></a></p><h3>General description of test program</h3>

Your test program should consist of the following general stages:<p>

</p><ul>
<a name="grd_test"></a><li>Ground testing<p>

</p><ul>
<li>Calibration of the ASI, altimeter and outside air temperature (OAT) 
indicator.  See <a href="http://www.eaa1000.av.org/technicl/instcal/instcal.htm">Pitot-Static 
Instrument Calibration</a> from the EAA Chapter 1000 web site for 
instructions on calibrating the ASI and altimeter.  This Excel and OpenOffice <!-- Link 
Tag --><a href="asi2.zip">spreadsheet</a> converts between water manometer 
height and calibrated airspeed.  It may also be useful 
as the EAA Chapter 1000 site just gives a complex formula for that 
conversion.  Check with the manufacturer of your OAT gauge to determine 
whether calibration is required.<p>

</p></li><li>Leak checks of the pitot and static systems. See <a href="http://www.eaa1000.av.org/technicl/instcal/instcal.htm">Pitot-Static 
Instrument Calibration</a> from the EAA Chapter 1000 web site for 
instructions on leak checks.<p>
</p></li></ul>

<a name="gen_flt_test"></a></li><li>Flight testing - General Description<p>

</p><ul>
<li>The flight test consists of recording the indicated airspeed, 
altitude, OAT, flap and landing gear position, aircraft weight, plus data 
to determine the true airspeed (TAS).  TAS can be determined by many 
means.  This paper will describe the use of GPS ground speed to determine 
TAS.  In the past, timed runs on reciprocal tracks were used to determine 
TAS, but this method required flight at low altitude with calm air.<p>
</p></li></ul>

<a name="grd_test_2"></a></li><li>Ground testing<p>

</p><ul>
<li>If the flight test program was of a prolonged duration, it might be 
wise to do another leak check and then recheck the instrument 
calibrations.  If there is a leak, or the instrument calibrations have 
changed then you need to start over because you don't know when the leak 
or calibration change occurred.<p>
</p></li></ul>

<a name="gen_data_analysis"></a></li><li>Data analysis - General Description<p>

</p><ul>
<li>The TAS is determined by a means which is independent of the 
pitot-static system, then the calibrated airspeed (CAS) can be 
calculated.  This is compared against the indicated airspeed, corrected 
for instrument error, to determine the position error of the static 
system.  The error in the indicated altitude can then be calculated.<p>
</p></li></ul></li></ul>
<a href="#Top">Top</a><p>

<a name="flt_test"></a></p><h3>Flight Testing - Detailed Description</h3>

<a name="wx"></a><u>Weather</u> - the flight testing must be done in 
smooth air, with no up drafts or down drafts.  The test technique 
described here assumes a constant wind direction and speed, so avoid 
testing during weather conditions that may give wind shifts.<p>

<a name="tas"></a><u>TAS Determination</u> - It is recommended to use data 
from a GPS to determine TAS.  Formula are available to take data from 
three runs at headings 90 degrees apart, or three runs at tracks 90 
degrees apart, or three runs at any track.  The spreadsheet provided with 
these notes uses the three runs at any <b>track</b> method developed by 
Doug Gray (<a href="doug_gray/TAS_FNL4.pdf">Measuring True Airspeed using 
GPS</a>).  This method simplifies the flying, and does not rely on an 
accurate compass swing.  Doug Gray's <a href="doug_gray/TASCALC.XLS">Excel 
spreadsheet</a> is also available.</p><p>

Fly three legs at a constant heading, altitude and airspeed.  The run 
directions should be about 90 to 120 degrees apart.  All runs must be at 
the same airspeed and altitude.  For each run, record:
</p><ul>
<li>indicated airspeed, 
</li><li>pressure altitude (with altimeter set to 29.92 in HG or 1013.25 mb), 
</li><li>GPS ground speed,
</li><li>GPS track, 
</li><li>outside air temperature (OAT), 
</li><li>fuel remaining,
</li><li>flap and landing gear position.  
</li></ul>
Note that it will take some time for the GPS speed and track to 
stabilize.<p>

The more accurately you can fly the test points the more accurate a result 
you will obtain.  You can fly more accurately if you don't have to record 
the data your self.  It is useful to have a second person in the aircraft 
to record the data and watch for other traffic.</p><p>

The spreadsheet will calculate the TAS for each set of three legs.  
Compare the calculated winds for all runs that were done at the same 
altitude.  They should be very similar.  If any run shows a wind that 
differs from the others, something is wrong with the data and that run 
should be discarded.</p><p>

If you use another method to calculate TAS, you can directly input the TAS 
into column AH.  You will have to unprotect the worksheet (Tools menu in 
Excel).</p><p>
<a href="#Top">Top</a></p><p>

<a name="data_analysis"></a></p><h3>Data analysis</h3>
Use the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, available at <a href="ssec.zip">ssec.zip</a> for Excel for Office 95,  (<a href="ssec4.zip">ssec4.zip</a> for Excel 4).  The ZIP files also include 
these notes.<p>

Enter the <a href="#recovery_factor">recovery factor</a> for your OAT 
gauge.  Use a value of 0.8 for a general aviation type temperature probe 
if the manufacturer does not provide another value (see <a href="#which_recovery_factor">discussion</a> in the Technical Notes 
section).</p><p>

Enter the units for your airspeed indicator (kt, mph or km/h), GPS 
groundspeed (kt, mph or km/h) and OAT gauge (C or F) for degrees Celsius 
or Fahrenheit.</p><p>

Enter a reference altitude that you want to correct your data to (this 
could be sea level, or maybe the altitude of your home airport).</p><p>

Enter the GPS data from the three tracks, indicated airspeed, altitude and 
OAT.  If you know the instrument errors for the airspeed indicator and 
altimeter, enter them.  Airspeed indicator instrument error goes in column 
Z.  (corrected indicated airspeed = indicated airspeed + instrument error. 
i.e. the instrument error is positive if the corrected value is greater 
than the indicated value).   Similarly, the correction (if known) for 
altimeter instrument error goes in column AD (corrected altimeter reading 
= indicated altitude + instrument error. i.e. the instrument error is 
positive if the actual pressure altitude is greater than the indicated 
value).</p><p>

The Calibrated Airspeed for each test point is calculated and displayed in 
column AS.  The CAS error, at the test condition, is in column AT.  Note 
that this value does not include the instrument error, it is only the 
error in CAS caused by the static source instrument error.  For example, 
if you had an IAS of 150 kt, with a +3 kt instrument error, your corrected 
IAS would be 153.  If the CAS is calculated as 155, you have a +2 kt error 
due to position error.</p><p>  

If you did an airspeed indicator calibration to determine the instrument 
error, and put the corrections in the spreadsheet, we can assume that all 
remaining errors are due to position error.  The amount of error in 
indicated altitude, caused by this position error, is provided in column 
AU, and the resulting error in the altitude indication is provided in 
column AU. </p><p>

<b>Important Note</b> - the calculated altitude errors are only valid if 
you have entered airspeed indicator instrument error.  Otherwise there is 
no way to know how much of the error in IAS is due to static source 
position error, and how much is due to instrument error.</p><p>

The position error may be affected by flap and landing gear position and 
gross weight.  You may want to gather data at light and heavy weights.  
The position error is certainly affected by airspeed, so you need to 
gather data over the full airspeed range of your aircraft.  This technique 
will only work for speeds that can be attained in level flight, but you 
may be able to plot airspeed error versus airspeed and extrapolate to 
VNE.</p><p>

<a name="tech_notes"></a></p><h3>Technical Notes</h3>

These notes supplement the rest of the document.  There is no need to read 
them unless you have an interest in some of the more arcane technical 
details.<p>

<a name="method"><b>Method of Calculation</b></a> - The TAS is determined 
by flying three legs at the same airspeed.  The GPS ground speed and 
tracks are used to calculate the TAS using formulae developed by Doug Gray 
(<a href="doug_gray/TAS_FNL4.pdf">Measuring True Airspeed using GPS - 
documentation</a>, <a href="doug_gray/TASCALC.XLS">spreadsheet</a> &amp; 
both docs  &amp; spreadsheet in a <a href="doug_gray/TASCALC.ZIP">ZIP</a> 
file).  </p><p>

Once the TAS is known, the rest of the method is as described in the US 
Air Force Test Pilot School (USAF TPS) course notes, except where 
specifically noted. </p><p>

The indicated air temperature is corrected for the ram temperature rise by 
applying the probe <a href="#recovery_factor">recovery factor</a>, to 
calculate the outside air temperature. </p><p>

The speed of sound is calculated given the outside air temperature (speed 
of sound in knots = 38.968 * SQRT(OAT + 273.15), with the OAT in degrees 
C).  The Mach number is calculated given the TAS and speed of sound.</p><p>

Then, a rather complex bunch of mathemagic is performed to compare the IAS 
(corrected for instrument error) against what the CAS should be for that 
mach number and altitude.  </p><p>

Assuming that all the remaining error in airspeed is due to the static 
source position error (see <a href="#error_must_be_static">above</a>), the 
amount of static source position error can then be calculated.   The 
formulae from the USAF TPS notes calculate the position error as a ratio 
of pressure error to the measured differential pressure (pitot pressure - 
static pressure).  This parametre (dPp/qcic) is in one of the hidden 
columns (column AQ, the parameter symbols are in hidden row 18).  The 
static pressure error is converted to an altitude error at the test 
altitude, and at the desired reference altitude.</p><p>

The USAF TPS notes also convert dPp/qcic to an error in CAS, and this is 
presented as CAS error at the reference altitude.  The result at the test 
altitude had a bit more error than I liked.  The result was that for a 
given test condition (TAS, altitude and temperature), the calculated CAS 
(calculated by adding the USAF TPS notes calculated CAS error to the IAS 
corrected for instrument error) varied if the IAS varied.  The error was 
small, but was not completely satisfying.  So, I jumped out on a limb, and 
calculated the CAS at the test condition given the Mach and pressure 
altitude, and then calculated the CAS error as the difference between the 
CAS and the IAS corrected for instrument error.  [CAS = speed of sound at 
sea level * 
SQRT(5*(((((1-0.00000687558*Hc)^5.2559)*((1+0.2*M^2)^3.5-1)+1)^(2/7))-1)), 
with Hc = pressure altitude and M = Mach].</p><p>

There are other documented methods of calculation, but many of the older 
ones use simplified,  approximate formulae, and are only accurate at low 
speeds (up to about 130 kt TAS in some cases).  This was necessary in the 
days when slide rules were used to do this sort of calculation, but today, 
more accurate methods of calculation can be used.  You will still be 
limited to the accuracy of your instruments, and the accuracy of your data 
points, but there is no need to introduce additional errors in the 
calculation methods given the power of modern computers.

</p><p>
<a href="#Top">Top</a></p><p>

<a name="recovery_factor"><b>Recovery Factor</b></a> - We need to measure 
the actual static temperature of the free stream air (Outside Air 
Temperature - OAT).  However, the air is moving relative to the aircraft, 
and its kinetic energy will get converted to heat as the air stops against 
the temperature probe (I am describing this as if the aircraft was 
stationary and the air moving - the same things happen if the air is 
stationary and the aircraft is moving).   So, our temperature probe does 
not measure the OAT, but actually sees some temperature warmer than that.  
There are many different names for this increased temperature measured by 
the probe, depending on how technical we want to get.  I will call it the 
Indicated Air Temperature (IAT).   In an ideal world, the IAT would be 
equal to the theoretical value.  </p><p>

</p><ul>
<li><b>Ideal World</b> - IAT/OAT =  1+0.2*Mach^2<p>

</p></li><li>In the real, imperfect, world the amount of temperature rise is 
slightly less than theory would predict.  The air does not completely stop 
at the surface of the probe, so all of the kinetic energy does not get 
recovered.  The actual temperature rise is equal to the theoretical 
temperature rise multiplied by the Recovery Factor (K).<p>

</p></li><li><b>Real World</b> - IAT/OAT =  1+0.2*K*Mach^2<p>

</p></li><li><a name="which_recovery_factor"></a>The manufacturer of your 
temperature probe should determine what the recovery factor is for that 
probe.  The really expensive probes have a recovery factor of around 0.95 
if they are properly mounted to have the air completely stop against the 
probe.  Light aircraft probes may have recovery factors as low as 0.7 if 
they are shaped so the air will pass around the probe without stopping 
along the whole area where the temperature is measured.  If you can't get 
a recovery factor from the probe manufacturer, make a guess.  The amount 
of error in the calculated OAT will be small for the speeds flown by most 
homebuilt aircraft.  The US Air Force Test Pilot School suggests a 
recovery factor of 0.8 for light aircraft OAT probes.<p>

</p></li><li><b>Note</b> - the temperatures in the above equations are referenced 
to absolute zero.  i.e. they are degrees Kelvin (¬∞K) or Rankine 
(¬∞R), not Celsius (¬∞C) or Fahrenheit (¬∞F).  <p>

</p><ul>
<li>The temperature in ¬∞K = temperature in ¬∞C + 273.15. <p>

</p></li><li>The temperature in ¬∞R = temperature in ¬∞F + 459.67.<p>
</p></li></ul>
</li><li>An equivalent, but sometimes more useful formula for the ram 
temperature rise is:<p>
</p><ul>
<li>IAT=OAT+K*TAS^2/7592 (temperatures in degrees C, and TAS in knots).  
<p>

</p></li><li>I found the above formula at <a href="http://www.best.com/~williams/avform.htm">Aviation Formulary</a> by 
Ed Williams.  It was very different from the classical formula with mach 
number, so I thought it was a compete fraud until I got bored one night 
and managed to derive it (I am very easily amused).
