# PiAvionics EFIS

This is my project to create a primarily python based avionics system for experimental aircraft.

This project is inspired by http://experimentalavionics.com and by https://customgt6.com/2021/03/28/custom-digital-gauge-cluster/.

The hardware is based on various Feather boards running CircuitPython that can be found at Adafruit (https://www.adafruit.com).
